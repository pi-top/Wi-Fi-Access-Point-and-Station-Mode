Description: Raspberry Pi Wireless Access Point
 Easily start and stop using your Raspberry Pi as a wireless access point.
 .
 This application is specifically developed to work on Raspberry Pi OS and
 derivatives, with some additional functionality to work with pi-topOS's DHCP
 server that is used for connecting to a pi-top [4] via the display cable (or
 connecting to a Pi via USB-OTG from the power connector).
